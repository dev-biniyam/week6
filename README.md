# Bank Institution Term Deposit Predictive Model

This project focuses on developing predictive models using classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, XGBoost and Multilayer Perceptrons.

**Case:**
The Bank of Portugal collected a huge amount of data that includes customers profiles of those who have to subscribe to term deposits and the ones who did not subscribe to a term deposit. Models developed by this work can help the bank identify customers who would or would not subscribe to their term deposit in the future. 

**Data Source:**
The dataset used in this notebook can be downloaded from the UCI ML (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing)
